      <p>The Happiness app is a more friendly and less clinical implementation of something called a <i>Dot Probe Task</i>.  This task is used by psychologists to study how peopleâ€™s attention is drawn by things like frowning faces or smiles and the extent of the attention paid to them.  It was originally called the <i>Visual Probe Task</i> by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata in 1986 and developed as the <i>Dot Probe Task</i> with Faces by Mogg and Bradley in 1998.  It has also been used to help people stop smoking.
      <p>We use the theory behind the task in this app to practice positive reinforcement so that the user can learn to focus more on the positive rather than the negative.  This is a kind of cognitive-behavioral therapy that may help lessen an automatic response people have to focus on the negative.  We believe that if you want happiness, then it will help to practice happiness.
